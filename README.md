# One-DNN-for-Joint-Face-Detection-and-Affect-Recognition
One DNN for Face Detection and Affect Recognition using Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), TensorFlow, Keras. Developed a unified model for real-time face detection and emotion recognition, achieving accurate classification of six basic emotions across a large image dataset.
The importance of emotions in rational decision-making, perception, and human interaction has sparked interest in programming computers to perceive and replicate emotions. DNN has become quite popular due to its accuracy when taught with essential data. ML is a set of algorithms that learns them, parses data, and applies what they've learned. This project aims to do research on joint face detection and affect recognition using a single DNN. Four standard pipelines are employed for joint face detection and affect credit in the face analysis area.
